This repository includes python code and jupyter notebook for an introduction to Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).


## 

The notebooks have been tested using miniconda3 with python3.6

To run the notebooks, here are some instructions
1. install the dependent libraries including, keras + tensorflow, jupyter notebook and others in requirements.txt
    
    conda install --file requirements.txt
    
2. create the checkpoint folder, `ckpt`.    
3. download the dataset into `data/` folder. Details are inside the notebooks.


## Credit

We adapt code from [keras example](https://github.com/fchollet/keras/tree/master/examples) and [fast.ai courses](https://github.com/fastai/courses) to creat the notebooks.
* MNIST CNN, CNN and RNN for sentiment analysis, Char RNN, Seq2Seq are from keras.
* CNN fine-tune is from fast.ai.
